The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. That is why all files loaded in this repository follow the general features described by the course: 

* The submitted data set is tidy.
* The Github repo contains the required scripts.
* GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
* The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

Following files was loaded in this repository:

1) tidyData.csv: a tidy data set.
2) CodeBook.md: A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
3) README.md: explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
